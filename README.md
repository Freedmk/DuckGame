# DuckGame
My first pygame game. Two Player vs space shooters except instead of space it's ducks :)

You can move any direction within your side and shoot up to 3 bullets at any given time

PLAYER ONE(GREEN DUCK):
  - press L-Ctrl to fire 
  - a to go left
  - d to go right
  - s to go down
  - w to go up
  
PLAYER TWO(YELLOW DUCK):
  - press R-Ctrl to fire 
  - left arrow to go left
  - right arrow to go right
  - down arrow to go down
  - up arrow to go up
